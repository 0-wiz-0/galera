 Galera Replication
===============

Galera Replication is a synchronous multi-master replication
plug-in for MySQL and MariaDB. It differs from the regular
MySQL Replication by, for example, addressing a number of
issues including write conflicts when writing on multiple
masters, replication lag and slaves being out of sync with the
master.

See below for an example of a typical Galera Replication
cluster:

Applications can write to any node in a Galera Replication
cluster, and transaction commits (RBR events) are then
applied on all servers, through certification-based replication.

Certification-based replication is an alternative approach to
synchronous database replication using group communication
and transaction ordering techniques.

A minimal Galera cluster consists of three nodes.
