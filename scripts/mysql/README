0. WHAT IS MYSQL/GALERA DEMO CLUSTER

MySQL/Galera demo cluster is a synchronous multi-master MySQL server cluster.
It consists of a single group communication daemon gcomm and several MySQL 
server instances which connect to it in a star-like fashion:

     ,--------.   ,---------.   ,--------.
     | mysqld |---|  gcomm  |---| mysqld |
     `--------'   `---------'   `--------'
                   /       \
            ,--------.   ,--------.
            | mysqld |   | mysqld |
            `--------'   `--------'

Server states are synchronized by replicating transaction changes at commit 
time. The cluster is virtually synchronous: this means that no node will commit
a transaction unless it is guaranteed to be committed on all other nodes. 
Together with flow control this makes the cluster

* Truly highly available: no transaction is ever lost in case of a node crash. 
  All nodes always have consistent state.

* True multi-master: all cluster nodes can handle WRITE load concurrently.

* Highly transparent: the cluster is intended as a drop-in replacement for a 
  single MySQL server. (See LIMITATIONS below)

* Scalable even with WRITE-intensive applications.

This package contains all software you'll need to setup MySQL/Galera demo 
cluster. You don't need administrative privileges or to uninstall/disable 
previously installed MySQL software to use this demo.


1. CLUSTER SETUP
               
To setup the cluster you will need several networked computers - one for each 
mysqld instance you plan to use. For best performance those computers should be
of approximately same configuration: Galera replication is synchronous and one 
slow machine will slow down the whole cluster.

You must also select one machine that would host group communication daemon 
(arbitrator). For best performance it should be a separate computer, but it 
also can be one of the MySQL nodes. The only requirement is that arbitrator is 
accessible to all other cluster nodes.

It takes 3 steps to set up the cluster:
1. Copy demo distribution to all prospective nodes of the cluster and unpack it.
2. Start group communication daemon on arbitrator node.
3. Start MySQL servers.

(NOTE: You can easily set up the cluster on a single computer, following the 
instructions below. However this makes little sense, as you won't see the the 
benefits of high availability and scalability.)
