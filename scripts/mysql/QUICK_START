Galera for MySQL Quick Start Guide
==================================

version 0.7.x

This is an informal guide to quick setup of MySQL/Galera cluster for 
experienced MySQL users. For more detailed information please see README.

MySQL/Galera cluster is a multi-master MySQL server cluster. It provides
 - True high-availability (no committed transaction is lost, no single
   point of failure)
 - Performance scalability even foe write-intensive loads.
 - Semantics of a single MySQL server.

This distribution is all you need to install and run MySQL/Galera cluster.
You don't need to be root or to uninstall/disable any software.

MYSQL CLUSTER IN 3 EASY STEPS:

To setup MySQL/Galera cluster all you need is to start an arbitrator and 
connect mysqld instances to it. Here's an example of how to do it:

Suppose you have three networked computers Node1, Node2, Node3 of roughly the 
same performance and Node1 has IP address 192.168.1.1

1. Copy and unpack this distribution on each node to the directory of your
   choice (hereafter INSTALL_DIR). The location must have at least 1Gb of free
   space for database files.

2. Start first MySQL server on Node1:

   <INSTALL_DIR>/mysql-galera -g gcomm:// start

3. Start remaining nodes:
   
   <INSTALL_DIR>/mysql-galera -g gcomm://192.168.1.1 start

NOTE1: First node of the cluster is started by supplying an empty gcomm address.
       When you want to add a node to a cluster, you must supply an address
       of any working cluster node.
NOTE2: Beginning from the second node, each node you start will automatically
       copy the contents of the database from one of the working nodes. Allow
       some time for it to complete - it depends on the size of the database.
       mysql-galera script will return when copying is done and node is ready
       to use. See README for details.

That's it. You've got a multi-master MySQL/Galera cluster. Node1, Node2 and 
Node3 will now synchronize all writes with the rest of the cluster.
Root password is 'rootpass' and there is also 'test' user with password 
'testpass' and privileges on 'test.*'. You can now populate your database 
with mysqldump by loading your database dump to (any) one of the nodes.


LIMITATIONS:

1. Currently replication works only with InnoDB storage engine. Any writes to 
   tables of other types, including system (mysql.*) tables are not replicated. 
   E.g. if you want to add another user, you have to do it manually on every
   node where you want that user to connect to.

2. Rows in tables without primary keys may appear in different order on
   different nodes. As a result SELECT...LIMIT... may return slightly different
   sets.

3. Unsupported in this release:
   commands: LOAD DATA.
   features: LOCKed sessions.
   Use at your own risk.


QUICK ANSWERS:

1. Arbitrator is gone an is no longer supported.

2. Yes, it works anywhere TCP works, including Amazon EC2(TM).

3. Yes, it'd be faster if there were a dedicated network for replication
   connections and a separate network for MySQL client connections.

4. Yes, it is highly configurable and flexible. For more info see README, 
   mysql-galera --help and my.cnf that comes with the distribution.

5. If your application cannot utilize more than one server, you can use TCP 
   connection balancer like GLB (http://www.codership.com/products/downloads) 
   or pen (http://siag.nu/pen/).
   Note however, that SQL traffic balancing is very CPU consuming (due to high
   number of small packets), so it is recommended to have a dedicated 
   machine for load balancer.
