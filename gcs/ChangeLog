    State exchange (GCS state exchange, not application state exchange)
    implemented. Now we have some sort of quourum calculations and global-scope
    sequence numbers. New nodes can join without having to restart the whole
    group. Bumped package version to 0.6.0.

    START/STOP-based flow control. A little bit ahead of the plan.
    
2008-07-30 Alex 
    Added gcs_join() and gcs_wait() getting closer to final API.
    gcs_join() moves conneciton to JOINED state.
    gcs_wait() blocks waiting for the group memebers to catch up.

2008-05-14 Alex 
    Added gcs_create() and gcs_destroy() for safe and clean initialization and
    deinitialization of GCS connection handle.

2008-03-23 Alex 
    Added gcs_set_last_applied() and gcs_get_last_applied() - calls for voting
    for the last applied action.
