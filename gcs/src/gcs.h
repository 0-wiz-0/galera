 * communication layer must be delivered as a single message.
 *
 * For the purpose of this work "action" is a higher level concept
 * introduced to overcome the message size limitation. Application
 * replicates information in actions of ARBITRARY size that are
 * fragmented into as many messages as needed. As such actions
 * can be delivered only in primary configuration, when total order
 * of underlying messages is established.
 * The best analogy for action/message concept would be word/letter.
 *
 * The purpose of GCS library is to hide message handling from application.
 * Therefore application deals only with "actions".
 * Application can only send actions of types GCS_ACT_TORDERED,
 * GCS_ACT_COMMIT_CUT and GCS_ACT_STATE_REQ.
 * Actions of type GCS_ACT_SYNC, GCS_ACT_CONF are generated by the library.
